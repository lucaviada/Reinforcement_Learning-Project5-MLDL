# Models
Model files to test an RL agent by means of test.py.

Each of the following models has been developed with a specific configuration described in our paper, trained in the source domain.

In particular, each file is named according to its configuration in the form 'model_gamma_learningRate_optimizer.mdl'.

The file 'model_vanilla_target.mdl' refers to a model trained in the target domain with the best configuration found.
